/// Layout-contract guard for the macOS-27 panel-collapse regression.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
///
/// On macOS 27, the `MenuBarExtra(.window)` panel collapsed and the effect
/// list vanished. Root cause: `ChainEditorView`'s `ScrollView` had only a
/// `.frame(maxHeight:)` constraint with no floor. A `ScrollView` reports no
/// intrinsic height; when the window's fitting-size pass ran it resolved the
/// scroll region to zero, collapsing the whole panel. The fix added
/// `.frame(minHeight: 200, maxHeight: 440)` to the scroll region and
/// `.frame(minHeight: 420, maxHeight: 700)` to `ControlPanelView`'s root.
///
/// These tests guard the contract by hosting the view in an
/// `NSHostingController`, pinning its width to 380 pt, and asserting the
/// fitting height stays within the specified floor/cap. They exercise the
/// real SwiftUI layout pass — not a snapshot at a fixed caller-dictated
/// size — so a reintroduced collapse (fitting height -> 0) will fail them.
///
/// IMPORTANT CAVEAT
///
/// This guard catches the collapse on whatever macOS version the test runs
/// on. The macOS-27-specific manifestation requires running on macOS 27
/// (local developer machine or a self-hosted CI runner), because GitHub
/// Actions does not offer a macOS 27 image as of 2026-06. On macOS 26 and
/// earlier the panel does not collapse — the regression is OS-version-
/// specific. Running these tests on any available macOS version still
/// provides a meaningful regression guard: a refactor that removes the
/// `minHeight` floor would fail them everywhere.
