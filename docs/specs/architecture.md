# Architecture

tap-n-filter is a macOS menubar app that captures audio from a selected application via Core Audio process taps, runs the captured stream through a configurable graph of audio effects, and plays the result to the default output device.

This document describes the overall structure. Sub-specs cover each layer in more detail.

The app is a single process. There is no helper daemon, no XPC service, no kernel extension.

## Module layout

Top-level Swift modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `tap_n_filter` (app target) | App entry, scene composition, `MenuBarExtra`. |
| `Capture` | Core Audio process tap, aggregate device, bridge to `AVAudioEngine`. |
| `Graph` | The `Graph` type and `EffectNode` protocol. |
| `Effects` | Concrete effect implementations (`EQNode`, `ReverbNode`). |
| `Presets` | `GraphPreset`, `PresetStore`, bundled presets. |
| `UI` | SwiftUI views, view model. |

Lower-level utilities (logging, error wrappers, helpers) live alongside their primary consumer rather than in a shared `Utilities` module.

## Threading model

- **Main thread** owns the UI and the view model.
- **Audio thread** is managed by `AVAudioEngine`. The orchestrator does not call into audio-thread code from the main thread except via the engine's safe-update APIs (`engine.attach`, `engine.connect`, etc.) called while the engine is paused.
- **Capture thread(s)** are managed by Core Audio. Buffer callbacks fire on a CoreAudio-internal queue and are bridged into the engine via the aggregate device.

The view model communicates with `CaptureController` via Combine publishers. State changes are observed on the main queue.

Locking: no manual locks. Concurrency is managed by Swift's structured concurrency (`async`/`await`) for setup/teardown, and by `AVAudioEngine`'s own synchronization for the live signal path. Parameter changes from the UI to effect nodes are written to `AVAudioUnit` parameter values, which are safe to update from any thread.

## Lifecycle

1. App launches. SwiftUI scene starts. The `MenuBarExtra` icon appears.
2. The view model initializes with the default graph (empty if no last-session state, otherwise the persisted state).
3. The user opens the menubar dropdown. The control panel renders.
4. The user selects a source. The view model creates a `CaptureSource` from the selection.
5. The user clicks the power toggle.
6. The view model asks `CaptureController` to start the capture for the selected source, passing in the configured `AVAudioEngine` instance.
7. `CaptureController` creates a tap on the source process, creates an aggregate device, configures the engine's input node to read from that device, starts the engine, and reports `.running`.
8. Audio flows: source → tap → aggregate device → engine input → graph → mixer → output.
9. The user adjusts parameters. The view model writes new values into the relevant effect nodes. Changes are audible in real time.
10. The user toggles power off. `CaptureController.stop` is called. The engine pauses, the aggregate device and tap are released, the source app's normal output resumes.

## Permission model

The app requests one permission: audio capture, granted via the system prompt triggered by the first call to `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`. The prompt's text comes from the `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` value in `Info.plist`.

No microphone, camera, screen recording, location, or contacts access. The app does not network. The app does not read or write files outside its sandbox-equivalent paths (`~/Library/Application Support/tap-n-filter/`, `~/Library/Preferences/`, and wherever the user saves `.tnf` files via the open/save panels).

## Sandbox

The app is **not sandboxed** in V1. See `docs/decisions/ADR-003-no-sandbox-v1.md`. This decision preserves the path to AUv3 plugin hosting in a future version. The trade-off: no Mac App Store distribution in V1. The app is distributed as a signed, notarized DMG instead, which is acceptable for the V1 audience.

## Persistence

The app uses two locations:

- `UserDefaults` for last-session state (current graph, last source, UI preferences).
- The Application Support directory at `~/Library/Application Support/tap-n-filter/` for any future state that's too large for UserDefaults (custom IRs, user-imported presets). V1 doesn't write here yet; the directory is created lazily.

User-saved presets are explicit `.tnf` files at user-chosen paths (typically `~/Documents/` or `~/Music/`). The app does not auto-save user presets anywhere.

## Extension points

The architecture commits to the following extension points for future versions:

1. **New effect types** — anything conforming to `EffectNode` can be added to the graph. V1 ships EQ and Reverb. Adding a new effect is one new Swift file plus registering its `typeIdentifier` with the preset deserializer.

2. **AUv3 plugin hosting** — reserved for V2. A future `AUv3Node: EffectNode` wraps a hosted AUv3 unit. The architecture does not include the loader in V1, but the protocol surface accommodates it.

3. **Custom IRs for reverb** — reserved for V2 unless the V1 ear test fails on factory IRs. A future `ConvolutionNode: EffectNode` would replace or supplement `ReverbNode` with `AVAudioUnitEffect`-based convolution or an `Accelerate.vDSP_conv` implementation.

4. **Preset registry** — V2 may add an in-app preset browser that pulls from a GitHub-hosted index of community presets. The `.tnf` format is designed to be shared as plain text files; a registry layer would only add discovery.

5. **Multi-source capture** — V2. The architecture allows the engine to be configured with multiple input buses if a future `MultiSourceCaptureController` is built; V1 hard-codes single-source.

## Constraints and non-goals

- **Latency.** V1 is for ambient listening, not real-time monitoring. Round-trip latency of 50–100ms is acceptable. The architecture doesn't optimize for sub-10ms latency.
- **Channel count.** V1 supports stereo only. Multi-channel (5.1, Atmos) is out of scope.
- **Sample rate.** The engine runs at the aggregate device's native sample rate (typically 44.1 or 48 kHz depending on the source). The graph is sample-rate agnostic.
- **Cross-platform.** V1 is macOS only. No iOS, no Linux, no Windows. The Core Audio process tap API is macOS-specific.
- **Recording.** V1 does not record processed output to a file. (V0.2 may add an "export rendered output" feature.)

## Open architectural questions

Tracked in `docs/decisions/uncertainty-log.md`. Notable entries seeded at scribing time:

- The exact bridging strategy from Core Audio process tap to `AVAudioEngine` (aggregate-device vs raw HAL callback). ADR-001 commits to AudioCap's pattern; uncertainty log captures the fallback.
- Whether `AVAudioUnitReverb` factory presets are sufficient or whether custom IR convolution is needed for V1's aesthetic. Phase 2's ear test resolves this.
- Whether `MenuBarExtra` can host modal panels (Save / Open) without workarounds on macOS 14.4. Phase 3 verifies.
