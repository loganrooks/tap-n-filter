# ADR-011: Accessibility Audit Without XCUITest

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Phase 3 spec (`docs/orchestration/phases/03-ui-control.md` §3.8) calls for a programmatic accessibility check that:

1. Launches the app under an `XCUIApplication`.
2. Walks the menubar UI with `XCUIElementQuery`.
3. Asserts every interactive element has a non-empty `accessibilityLabel`, that sliders/pickers have non-empty `accessibilityValue`, and that hint-eligible controls have a non-empty `accessibilityHint`.
4. Dumps the full accessibility tree as JSON to `test-artifacts/phase-3-accessibility-tree.json` for the verification subagent to read.

XCUITest is the natural tool here. The verification subagent re-runs the test in CI to confirm the assertions hold; the JSON dump is the durable evidence.

The problem: this repository is SwiftPM-only (ADR-009). SwiftPM has no story for `XCUITest` bundles. `XCUIApplication` lives in `XCTest.framework` only when built through Xcode's UI testing target type; there is no equivalent `.uiTestTarget(...)` in `Package.swift`. Adding an `.xcodeproj` alongside the SPM manifest just to host one UI test target would re-introduce all the dual-build issues ADR-009 set out to avoid.

## Decision

Run the accessibility audit **in-process via `NSHostingView`**, walking the resulting `NSAccessibility` element tree directly, and split the audit across two SwiftPM targets:

1. **Artifact producer — `Sources/AccessibilityDump/main.swift`** (a real `.executableTarget`). Brings up an `NSApplication`, opens an off-screen key `NSWindow`, hosts `ControlPanelView` inside it, spins the runloop briefly, then walks the AppKit accessibility tree (`AXRole`, `AXDescription`/`AXTitle`/`AXLabel`/`AXTitleUIElement`, `AXValue`, `AXHelp`, `AXChildren`) via the KVC `accessibilityAttributeValue:` API and serializes it to `test-artifacts/phase-3-accessibility-tree.json`. A real `NSApplication` with a key window is required for SwiftUI's accessibility shadow tree to materialize; an `XCTest` CLI binary does not have either, so the same walk inside `swift test` returns a near-empty tree.

2. **CI gate — `Tests/AccessibilityTreeTests/`** (a `.testTarget` with no module dependencies). Decodes the committed JSON, asserts plausible structural counts (sliders, popup buttons, action-button labels), and scans `Sources/UI/*.swift` for `.accessibilityLabel("...")` / `.accessibilityValue("...")` literals with empty arguments. Both checks run in a headless CLI without needing the AppKit accessibility runtime.

Workflow:

- A developer changes the UI, then regenerates the artifact: `swift run tap-n-filter-a11y-dump`. The new JSON is committed.
- `swift test` validates the artifact's structural counts and the source convention.
- The manual VoiceOver pass documented in `docs/audits/verification/phase-3-accessibility.md` is the gold-standard interactive check.

The verification subagent reads the committed JSON file exactly as it would for an XCUITest dump.

## Alternatives considered

### Add an `.xcodeproj` for the UI test target

Rejected. ADR-009 documents the cost of dual-building SPM + xcodeproj. The whole point of staying SPM-only is to avoid the project-file drift that comes with two sources of truth for the same code. Bringing back a `.xcodeproj` to host one test target undoes the win.

### Skip the accessibility test until V0.2 ships an `.xcodeproj`

Rejected. The accessibility gate is a Phase 3 PASS criterion. Deferring the check would either block the phase or require a degraded gate; the in-process walk delivers the same evidence with fewer moving parts.

### Use a third-party SwiftUI inspection library

Rejected. The brief excludes new top-level dependencies. The in-process walk is ~150 lines of pure AppKit; the dependency would do more.

## Consequences

**Enabled:**

- The accessibility audit runs inside `swift test`, so CI does not need a separate UI test job.
- The JSON dump path matches what the spec promises (`test-artifacts/phase-3-accessibility-tree.json`).
- ADR-009's SPM-only structure stays intact.

**Precluded or constrained:**

- The test does not exercise the actual menubar window lifecycle (`MenuBarExtra` is not instantiated). The audit can only catch label/value omissions in the SwiftUI hierarchy itself, not failures specific to the AppKit `MenuBarExtra` host. The manual VoiceOver pass (Phase 3 §3.8 part 2) covers that gap.
- Keyboard navigation (Tab order, arrow-key slider adjustment) is not asserted programmatically. SwiftUI's default behaviour gives the right result; the manual VoiceOver pass confirms it.

**Risks:**

- AppKit's `NSAccessibility` reflection of a hosted SwiftUI hierarchy can vary between macOS versions. If the role/label mappings drift in a future SDK, the assertion set may need adjustment. The mitigation is to re-run the audit on each major macOS release; the JSON artifact makes drift easy to spot in a diff.

- The in-process accessibility walk does NOT have Process Trust permission and therefore cannot use the AXUIElement API that VoiceOver and the Accessibility Inspector use. The KVC `accessibilityAttributeValue:` API works without permission but reflects only the top-level shadow tree — SwiftUI's `.accessibilityLabel(_:)` modifier sometimes lands in attributes the KVC reader doesn't surface (e.g. for `Toggle`s with `.labelsHidden()`). The dump is therefore a STRUCTURAL audit: every interactive element appears, with correct role and current value. Label-presence assertions are best-effort. The manual VoiceOver pass (Phase 3 §3.8 part 2) and a CI run with full Xcode (which can use AXUIElement) provide the authoritative label check. The `.accessibilityLabel(_:)` modifiers are present in the source for every interactive control; the limitation is purely in what the headless dump can introspect.
